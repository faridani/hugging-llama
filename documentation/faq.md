# Installation problems 

Q: I get the following error

```bash
ERROR:    [Errno 10048] error while attempting to bind on address ('127.0.0.1', 11434): only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted
```

A: simply change your port to something else. For example 11435 should work
